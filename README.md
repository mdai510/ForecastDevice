Weather Forecast Device
Uses WiFi connection to find your approx. location, then call weather API with that location

Planning for current weather, rest of day weather, and next 3-4 days weather

Currently you have to enter the network id/passwork into the code directly. 
This may change after I add make the LCD screen functional + buttons maybe
